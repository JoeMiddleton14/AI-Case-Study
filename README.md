Second Spectrum is revolutionizing the way we consume sports.  Based out of Los Angeles, CA, Second Spectrum is a spatiotemporal data analytics company that enriches the way people interact with, underdstand and enjoy sports.

[Second Spectrum](https://www.secondspectrum.com/index.html) was founded in 2013 by Jeff Su, Rajiv Maheswaran, Yu-Han Chang and has become a world-leading and fully integrated sports AI provider, offering tracking, analytics and data visualization services.

Second Spectrum relied on private investors including two lead [investors](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/second-spectrum/company_financials), Lion Tree and August Capital.  In 2021, [Genius Sports](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834489/000119312521153436/d431115dex991.htm) acquired Second Spectrum for $200 million.

## The Journey

Second Spectrum enables new and compelling content and experiences through interactive applications and augmented video that help media, teams and fans visualize and personalize the game.

Second Spectrum's real-time augmentation pipeline allows them to produce visually and appealing content rapidly.  With the use of interactive applications, producers, editors, and fans can create hundreds of stories and highlights in minutes through simple web interfaces and embeddable APIs.

In 2016 and in collaboration with Sportsradar's state-of-the-art player tracking system, Second Spectrum used machine learning and computer vision techniques to produce fast and accurate location data for the NBA.  The data provided avdanced statistics such as player speed, distance, defensive impact, and quality of shot.



The Youtube video below explains how data analytics, machine learning and sports come together:

In March, 2023 the [NBA](https://pr.nba.com/nba-genius-sports-second-spectrum-expanded-partnership/#:~:text=We%20are%20the%20trusted%20partner,NASCAR%2C%20AFA%20and%20Liga%20MX.) announced a multi-year partnership with Second Spectrum.  The two are working together to develop "Dragon," a platform that will track ‚Äúmesh‚Äù data, which aims to synthesize millions of on-court basketball data points.

## Similar Companies and Tech

Other companies that offer augmented reality and computer vision technology include [Basemark](https://www.basemark.com/?utm_term=basemark&utm_campaign=Search-Campaing-Rocksolid&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=2843187597&hsa_cam=14935452885&hsa_grp=125689726542&hsa_ad=640277895105&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-372807042398&hsa_kw=basemark&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7-SvBhB6EiwAwYdCAaD4qHkGrp3RLf2Pukj1WhbYYgBXf7UsqcL2vr2g7DrIzpysVJqF1BoCck8QAvD_BwE), [Kudan](https://www.kudan.io/), and [Immersive Gaze](http://immersivegaze.com/), not many other companies compare to what Second Spectrum provides an unparalled machine understanding of every game.  [Kitman Labs](https://www.kitmanlabs.com/) is similar in that they're sports based, but focus more on performance optimization, coaching and development.  

## Hopeful Future

Technology has been used in sports for several years to correct a ruling, particularly at the professional level.  Offsides in soccer, where the ball lands in correlation to the lines in tennis, goal-tending in basketball, just to name a few.  There is still the human element of officiating and officials make human mistakes, some resulting in the outcome of the game.  With the implementaion of maching learning and computor vision,I feel we are nearing the technology necessary to remove mistakes from human officials.
